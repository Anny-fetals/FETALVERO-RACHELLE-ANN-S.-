        <h1>ENCHANTED  by: Taylor Swift</h1>
            <p>[Verse 1]</p>
            <p>There I was again tonight</p>
            <p>Forcing laughter, faking smiles</p>
            <p>Same old tired, lonely place</p>
            <p>Walls of insincerity, shifting eyes and vacancy</p>
            <p>Vanished when I saw your face</p>
            <p>All I can say is, it was enchanting to meet you</p>

            <p>[Verse 2]</p>
            <p>Your eyes whispered, "Have we met?"</p>
            <p>'Cross the room your silhouette</p>
            <p>Starts to make its way to me</p>
            <p>The playful conversation starts</p>
            <p>Counter all your quick remarks</p>
            <p>Like passing notes in secrecy</p>

            <p>[Pre-Chorus]</p>
            <p>And it was enchanting to meet you</p>
            <p>All I can say is, I was enchanted to meet you</p>

            <p>[Chorus]</p>
            <p>This night is sparkling</p>
            <p>Don't you let it go</p>
            <p>I'm wonderstruck</p>
            <p>Blushing all the way home</p>
            <p>I'll spend forever</p>
            <p>Wondering if you knew</p>
            <p>I was enchanted to meet you</p>

            <p>[Verse 3]</p>
            <p>The lingering question kept me up</p>
            <p>2AM, who do you love?</p>
            <p>I wonder 'til I'm wide awake</p>
            <p>And now I'm pacing back and forth</p>
            <p>Wishing you were at my door</p>
            <p>I'd open up and you would say, "Hey"</p>


            <p>[Chorus]</p>
            <p>This night is sparkling</p>
            <p>Don't you let it go</p>
            <p>I'm wonderstruck</p>
            <p>Blushing all the way home</p>
            <p>I'll spend forever</p>
            <p>Wondering if you knew</p>
            <p>This night is flawless</p>
            <p>Don't you let it go</p>
            <p>I'm wonderstruck</p>
            <p>Dancing around all alone</p>
            <p>I'll spend forever</p>
            <p>Wondering if you knew</p>
            <p>I was enchanted to meet you</p>

            <p>[Guitar Solo]</p>

            <p>[Bridge]</p>
            <p>This is me praying that</p>
            <p>This was the very first page</p>
            <p>Not where the storyline ends</p>
            <p>My thoughts will echo your name</p>
            <p>Until I see you again</p>
            <p>These are the words I held back</p>
            <p>As I was leaving too soon</p>
            <p>I was enchanted to meet you</p>


            <p>[Breakdown]</p>
            <p>Please don't be in love</p>
            <p>With someone else</p>
            <p>Please don't have somebody</p>
            <p>Waiting on you</p>
            <p>Please don't be in love (Ooh)</p>
            <p>With someone else</p>
            <p>Please don't have somebody (Ooh, hey)</p>
            <p>Waiting on you</p>

            <p>[Chorus]</p>
            <p>This night is sparkling</p>
            <p>Don't you let it go</p>
            <p>I'm wonderstruck</p>
            <p>Blushing all the way home</p>
            <p>I'll spend forever</p>
            <p>Wondering if you knew</p>
            <p>This night is flawless</p>
            <p>Don't you let it go</p>
            <p>I'm wonderstruck</p>
            <p>Dancing around all alone</p>
            <p>I'll spend forever</p>
            <p>Wondering if you knew</p>
            <p>I was enchanted to meet you</p>

            <p>[Outro]</p>
            <p>Please don't be in love</p>
            <p>With someone else</p>
            <p>Please don't have somebody</p>
            <p>Waiting on you</p>
